Here we begin looking at several unsupervised estimators, which can highlight interesting aspects of the data without reference to any known labels.\n",

PCA is fundamentally a dimensionality reduction algorithm, but it can also be useful as a tool for visualization, for noise filtering, for feature extraction and engineering, and much more. After a brief conceptual discussion of the PCA algorithm, we will see a couple examples of these further applications.\n",
